## Laravel Login with Tumblr oAuth 1.0a

This is the code for a demo I created to login with Tumblr. The app is built using Laravel PHP framework. I have tried several PHP/Tumblr OAuth packages to find out the best one.


## Includes examples of:

* Connect to Tumblr using oAuth 1.0a
* Connect to Facebook using OAuth 2
* Mutiple coding attempts with different packages to authorise with Tumblr API.
